**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed ([https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en))

   git clone https://github.com/Sneekyboots/Nft-market-place-with-ai
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd Nft-market-place-with-ai
   npm install (or yarn install)
   ```
4. **Configure Prisma Client:**
   - Follow Prisma's instructions to connect your frontend to your Prisma service ([https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client))
